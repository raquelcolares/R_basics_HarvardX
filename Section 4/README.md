## Section 4

Section 4 introduces you to general programming features like 'if-else' and 'for loop' commands so that you can write your own functions to perform various operations on datasets.

In Section 4.1:

* Understand some of the programming capabilities of R. 

In Section 4.2:

* Use basic conditional expressions to perform different operations. 
* Check if any or all elements of a logical vector are TRUE. 

In Section 4.3:

* Define and call functions to perform various operations.
* Pass arguments to functions, and return variables/objects from functions.

In Section 4.4:

* Use for-loops to perform repeated operations. 
* Articulate in-built functions of R that you could try for yourself.
