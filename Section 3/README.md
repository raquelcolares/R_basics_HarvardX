Section 3 introduces the R commands and techniques that help you wrangle, analyze, and visualize data.

In Section 3.1:

* Subset a vector based on properties of another vector. 
* Use multiple logical operators to index vectors.
* Extract the indices of vector elements satisfying one or more logical conditions. 
* Extract the indices of vector elements matching with another vector.
* Determine which elements in one vector are present in another vector. 

In Section 3.2:

* Wrangle data tables using functions in the dplyr package. 
* Modify a data table by adding or changing columns. 
* Subset rows in a data table.
* Subset columns in a data table. 
* Perform a series of operations using the pipe operator. 
* Create data frames. 

In Section 3.3:

* Plot data in scatter plots, box plots, and histograms. 

In Section 3.4:

* Use summarize() to facilitate summarizing data in dplyr.
* Learn about the dot placeholder.
* Learn how to group and then summarize in dplyr.
* Learn how to sort data tables in dplyr.

In Section 3.5:
